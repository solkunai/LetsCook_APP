Let's Cook: Raffle-Based Token
Launchpad on Solana
Outsmarting the Dev Dump
Picture this: You’re hyped for a new memecoin launch. You ape in early, your wallet’s ready, and
you’re dreaming of 10x gains. But before the token even bonds, BAM—the devs dump their
bags, the price tanks, and your SOL is gone. Sound familiar? We’ve all been burned by those
shady launches where the only winners are the devs cashing out.
Not anymore. Let's Cook flips the script. Our raffle-based launchpad on Solana ensures a fair
shot for everyone—no more losing your hard-earned SOL to instant dumps. With transparent
raffles, guaranteed refunds for losing tickets, and automated liquidity pools, we’re cooking up a
recipe for safe, fun, and equitable token launches. Say goodbye to the old playbook and hello to
a tastier way to launch!
Overview
Let's Cook is a mobile application built on the Solana blockchain, revolutionizing token
launches with a raffle-style mechanism. Designed to address the frustrations of unfair launches
and dev dumps, it ensures safe, transparent, and engaging token distributions for users and
customizable options for developers. By leveraging Solana’s high-speed, low-cost transactions,
Let's Cook creates a vibrant ecosystem for memecoins and beyond.
Purpose
The raffle-based approach delivers:
●
Fairness: Equal chances for all participants via randomized winning tickets.
●
Safety: Refunds for losing tickets and failed raffles protect users from losses.
●
Engagement: A gamified raffle system makes launches exciting and accessible.
●
Flexibility: Developers can tailor tokenomics to fit their project’s vision.
Key Features
1. Raffle-Based Token Launches: Users buy tickets for a chance at token allocations,
with losing tickets refunded (minus a small platform fee), preventing losses from dev
dumps.
2. Customizable Tokenomics: Developers allocate percentages for airdrops, marketing,
market-making rewards, team, and liquidity pools (e.g., $TOKEN/SOL).
3. Guaranteed Liquidity Threshold: Ensures sufficient funds for a viable liquidity pool; if
unmet, raffles fail, and all tickets are refunded, safeguarding user investments.
4. Automated Liquidity Pool Deployment: Triggered by the first winning ticket claim,
enabling immediate trading without manual intervention.
5. User-Friendly Mobile App: Browse raffles, purchase tickets, and claim winnings with an
intuitive, vibrant interface.
